Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.10 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/yieldr/terraform-provider-auth0`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/yieldr; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yieldr
$ git clone git@github.com:yieldr/terraform-provider-auth0
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yieldr/terraform-provider-auth0
$ make build
```

Using the provider
------------------

The provider isn't listed in the official Terraform repository, so using `terraform init` to download the provide won't work. To install the auth0 provider, you can [download the binary](https://github.com/yieldr/terraform-provider-auth0/releases) and place in the directory `~/.terraform.d/plugins` (or `%APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/` if you're on Windows).

To use the provider define the `auth0` provider in your `*.tf` file.

```
provider "auth0" {
  "domain" = "<domain>"
  "client_id" = "<client-id>"
  "client_secret" = "<client-secret>"
}
```

These variables can also be accessed via the `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables respectively.

Examples of resources can be found in the [examples directory](example/). The currently supported Auth0 resources are described below.

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.10+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

On how to develop custom terraform providers, read the [official guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html).

To compile the provider, run `make install`. This will build the provider and install the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make install
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-auth0
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
